## Introduction

The Surveillance, Innovation, and Research (SIR) Team within the Polio Eradication Branch at CDC obtains global polio data from [POLIS](https://extranet.who.int/polis/Account/Login). Collaborators outside of CDC who wish to download and process global polio data using the tidypolis package must have access to POLIS beforehand, as well obtain a POLIS API key.

This guide is tailored for collaborators who wish to use the sirfunctions package to analyze global polio data and have access to data in POLIS.
