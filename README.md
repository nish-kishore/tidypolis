# tidypolis
A package to simplify downloading, caching and updating POLIS data. Functions 
to clarify agency specific pre-processing and data cleaning steps are also included. 

# Usage
First make sure you have `devtools` installed. Then run the following command: 

```
devtools::install_github("nish-kishore/tidypolis")
```

After you can use any function developed in this package using 

```
tidypolis::{function}
```

# Quick start 
- Use the `tidypolis::init_tidypolis()` function to create a folder to store and update POLIS data. 
You must specify if you wish the folder to be stored locally or on the EDAV environment by setting 
the `edav` parameter in the function to `T` or `F`. 
- This function will ask for your POLIS API key so please have this ready
- Use the `tidypolis::get_polis_data()` to pull all POLIS data and reconcile any missing or updated information, 
the data will be stored in the local folder or in the EDAV environment you've specified. 
- Use `tidypolis::preprocess_data(type = "cdc")` to process all POLIS data with cleaning methodologies 
used by the SIR team. This requires access to the CDC EDAV environment. If you do not have this access please 
contact us to get the pre-requisite data files to run this process locally.
