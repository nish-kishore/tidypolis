\description{
This function processes a raw AFP dataset by standardizing date formats,
renaming variables for consistency, and calculating derived date variables.
}
\details{
The function performs the following transformations:
\itemize{
\item Renames variables to remove special characters and spaces
\item Converts date strings to ymd format using lubridate
